# Setupist
Setupist is a Ninite-like software installation helper that includes additional links to install packages that are not available on Ninte.

Instalation is silent, but not completely since some software does not support it.

#### Why?
The sole purpose of this app is personal automation. However, if someone wants to use it, modify it or whatsoever, feel free to do so. Also, any suggestions are welcome.

#### Personalization

To quickly install software on a large number of devices (or any other use, really), a personalized installer can be created by using the *download.txt* file. 

In the file, one under another, should be written keywords as stated later in this readme file. Example:

```text
chrome
dropbox
vlc-64bit
```
