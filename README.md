# Setupist
Setupist is a ninite-like software installation helper that includes additional links to install packages that are not available on Ninte.

#### Why?
The sole purpose of this app is personal automation. However, if someone wants to use it, modify it or whatsoever, feel free to do so. Also, any suggestions are welcome.

#### Personalization

To quickly install software on a large number of devices (or any other use, really), a personalized installer can be created by using the download.txt file. 

In the file, one under another, should be written keywords as stated later in this readme file. Example:

```text
chrome
dropbox
```


#### Available packages
To be announced in later versions of this readme.
``` text 
chrome
```
